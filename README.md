# C
# Overview
This repository contains the coursework from one year of programming in C. The classes, CSC150 and CSC250, focus on arrays and algorithm design, debugging and testing, and sorting and searching. Additionally, I learned about how to integrate more advanced data types such as arrays, structures, and files.

# Prerequisites
### Windows
1. Install MinGW compiler for Windows
http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php/download
2. Follow the installation
3. Add the folder containing MINGW to the PATH Variable

### Linux
1. No prerequisites are required with Linux because Linux is cool
2. See #1

# How to Use

### Compile
```gcc filename.cpp```

If using Header files, compile them before the C file containing the main function

Example: gcc header.h header2.h main.c

### Execution

#### Linux
```./a.out```

#### Windows 
```a```
